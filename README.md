# LC-3 Electron
An LC-3 (and eventually ARM) emulator desktop app created with Electron. The majority of the code at this point (tag MWE) has been taken from [WebLC3](https://github.com/University-of-Manitoba-Computer-Science/WebLC3). The goal is to implement WebLC3 but with native desktop app features.

# Known Issues
